    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the need to install a newer version of ruby, since I hadn't updated in ages (I was on ruby-1.9.2-p290). For something I was working on I needed <code>ruby-1.9.3-rc1</code>.</p>

<p>Simple right? Just run</p>

<p><code>bash
rvm install ruby-1.9.3-rc1
</code></p>

<p>Well, not so much... Running that with an old rvm install led to nothing but cryptic hurt.</p>

<p>As it turns out, RVM has undergone some serious updates as well as a move to the .io TLD. I'm running OSX and using homebrew, so the first order of business was to update homebrew:</p>

<p><code>
brew update
</code></p>

<p>The next step is to install the new/latest version of RVM:</p>

<p><code>
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
</code></p>

<p>That got me a bit closer, but running <code>rvm install ruby-1.9.3-rc1</code> failed, but RVM was kind enough to let me know what was missing. So the next step was:</p>

<p><code>
brew install libyaml libxml2 libxslt libksba openssl sqlite
</code></p>

<p>Even closer... but still no love. The next step was to tell RVM to take care of any dependencies it needs, including installing homebrew if necessary (https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs/)</p>

<p><code>
rvm autolibs enable
</code></p>

<p>Success! Now I was able to install <code>ruby-1.9.3-rc1</code>, migrate the gems I had installed under <code>ruby-1.9.2-p290</code>, and tell RVM to use <code>ruby-1.9.3-rc1</code>:</p>

<p><code>
rvm install ruby-1.9.3-rc1
rvm migrate ruby-1.9.2-p290 ruby-1.9.3-rc1
rvm use ruby-1.9.3-rc1
</code></p>
