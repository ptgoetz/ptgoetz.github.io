    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you write code samples for an API or library -- or even a blog post -- you should treat it as though you are writing the production guidance system for the space shuttle. Okay, that may be a little extreme, but you should at least make your best effort to ensure the code is error free and follows best practices. Why? Any bugs, vulnerabilities, anti-patterns, or cruft of any kind <strong><em>will replicate like drunken bunnies.</em></strong></p>

<p>In a blog post titled <a href="http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0199/">Why Windows 8 drivers are buggy</a> Andrey Karpov discusses what he found when performing static analysis on Windows 8 driver examples published by Microsoft. In short, those examples aren't exactly stellar. But they're just examples and aren't that important, right? I beg to differ.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the salient point of the article is best summarized in the following paragraph (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>"<del>Bugs in samples are not that critical as bugs in real-life software.</del> Nevertheless, bugs can migrate from samples to real-life projects and cause developers a lot of troubles. Even within the Windows 8 Driver Samples pack we found identical bugs. The reason is obvious: copying-and-pasting a code fragment from a nearby sample. In the same way these errors will get into real-life drivers."</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, I would rearrange that first sentence to read: <em>"Bugs in samples will become critical bugs in real-life software."</em></p>

<p>The evils of <em>copying-and-pasting</em> aside, the truth is that developers reading your sample code will likely (perhaps blindly) trust that a given example is the right way to do things. Like it or not, when writing examples you are acting as a teacher and can't make any assumptions about your pupils.</p>
